# XCITE-Chem-Equilibrium
 Unity project for dynamic equilibrium of NO2 <---> N2O4 
 
 NO2 and N2O4 molecules within a closed box interacting with each other through elastic collisions. The user is able to interact with a slider to produces NO2 molecules which may merge with each other to become N2O4. Displays phenomena such as pressure, chemical equilibirum, bonding, and heat.
